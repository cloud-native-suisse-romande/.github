# Hello, Cloud Native World!

“Cloud Native Suisse Romande” is the association created in 2024 by CNCF Ambassadors and local community leads.
We aim to connect end users, contributors, and maintainers of the projects in the cloud native computing (CNC) space,
within Suisse Romande (French-speaking regions of Switzerland) and neighboring locations.

If you're on the CNCF Slack, join us on the `#switzerland` channel!
